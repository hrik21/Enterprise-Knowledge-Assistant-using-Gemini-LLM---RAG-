# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a complete containerized RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based enterprise assistant system. The system leverages Gemini API for language model capabilities, LlamaIndex for document processing and retrieval, FAISS for vector storage, and Apache Airflow for orchestrating automated document ingestion pipelines. The goal is to create a production-ready, GitHub-ready project structure that demonstrates enterprise-grade RAG implementation with clear documentation and deployment instructions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete project structure with all necessary configuration files, so that I can easily understand, deploy, and contribute to the RAG enterprise assistant system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is cloned from GitHub THEN the repository SHALL contain a comprehensive README.md with setup instructions, architecture overview, and usage examples
2. WHEN examining the project structure THEN it SHALL include organized directories for source code, configuration, documentation, and deployment files
3. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN it SHALL include proper Python package structure with __init__.py files and clear module organization
4. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the project SHALL include requirements.txt, Dockerfile, and docker-compose.yml files for easy deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want containerized deployment capabilities, so that I can easily deploy and scale the RAG assistant in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL use Docker containers for all components (API server, Airflow, vector database)
2. WHEN running docker-compose up THEN the system SHALL automatically start all required services with proper networking
3. WHEN the containers start THEN they SHALL include health checks and proper logging configuration
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the architecture SHALL support horizontal scaling of API components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want an automated document ingestion pipeline, so that new documents are automatically processed and made available for retrieval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are added to the input directory THEN Airflow SHALL automatically trigger the ingestion pipeline
2. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL chunk documents using LlamaIndex with configurable chunk sizes
3. WHEN chunking is complete THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings and store them in FAISS vector database
4. WHEN the pipeline fails THEN it SHALL provide detailed error logging and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL update metadata and make documents searchable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to query the enterprise assistant through a REST API, so that I can retrieve relevant information from the document corpus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making a query request THEN the API SHALL accept natural language questions via HTTP POST
2. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL use FAISS to retrieve relevant document chunks
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL use Gemini API to create contextual answers based on retrieved documents
4. WHEN returning results THEN the API SHALL include the generated answer, source documents, and confidence scores
5. WHEN the API is overloaded THEN it SHALL implement rate limiting and proper error handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive configuration management, so that I can easily customize the system for different environments and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys
2. WHEN customizing behavior THEN the system SHALL include configuration files for chunk sizes, embedding models, and retrieval parameters
3. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN it SHALL support development, staging, and production configurations
4. WHEN updating configurations THEN the system SHALL validate configuration values and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want monitoring and observability features, so that I can track system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints for all services
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics including response times and token usage
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide structured logging with correlation IDs
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN it SHALL expose Prometheus metrics for key performance indicators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want proper security controls, so that the enterprise assistant handles sensitive data appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling API requests THEN the system SHALL implement authentication and authorization mechanisms
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information at rest
3. WHEN communicating between services THEN it SHALL use secure protocols and proper certificate management
4. WHEN processing documents THEN it SHALL include data sanitization and PII detection capabilities
